summary: a composite statement allowing to branch to multiple locations based on several conditions
format: [44:6:1] >> - "EVALUATE" - AnyExpression -2 #1 -21 ^22 - "END" - >< &1 \2 "WHEN" - #2 -2 Atomic - ^5 -3 Statement - ^7 /2 &2 \ - "OTHER" - /
remarks: <ul>
	* Essentially, the role of the <code>EVALUATE</code> statement is to bring infix expressions into the language, and they are needed to force the software language engineer to deal with parsing ambiguities between <code>A-B</code> and <code>A - B</code> where the first one is a name of a single field and the second one is a binary subtraction of two fields (spaces serve a demonstrative purpose in this example, and are ignored during by the lexical analyser).
	* Note that <code>WHEN</code>-branches consist of statements, not sentences.
	* Each branch ends with its last statement, and there is no fall-through or other form of control flow from one branch to another.
	* <a href="nextsentence.html"><code>NEXT SENTENCE</code></a> in the middle of <code>EVALUATE</code> statement works as usual, exiting it and continuing at the next sentence after it.
</ul>
