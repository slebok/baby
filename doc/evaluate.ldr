remarks: <ul>
	Essentially, the role of the <code>EVALUATE</code> statement is to bring infix expressions into the language, and they are needed to force the software language engineer to deal with parsing ambiguities between <code>A-B</code> and <code>A - B</code> where the first one is a name of a single field and the second one is a binary subtraction of two fields (spaces serve a demonstrative purpose in this example, and are ignored during by the lexical analyser).
