summary: a statement to branch unconditionally to a paragraph within a program
format: [17:3:0] >> - "GO_TO" - ProcedureName - ><
// todo: the CC paper also included GO TO ... OR ...
remarks: <ul>
	* branching outside an active <code>LOOP</code> terminates its iteration
	* branching outside paragraphs being <code>PERFORM</code>ed terminates the performance and forfeits the call place, acting as a redirected return
	* the argument can be a field name, possibly being reassigned at runtime with <code>MOVE</code>
	* See a <a href="perform-goto.html">separate example</a> showcasing the interplay between <a href="perform.html"><code>PERFORM</code></a> and <code>GO TO</code>.
</ul>
