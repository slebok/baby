summary: a statement to change the target of an existing GO TO statement

remarks: <ul>
	* Essentially, the dreaded <code>GO TO</code> that has been considered harmful since 1968, is only hard on the end developer, but not on a software language engineer. Its implementation in a compiler is almost trivial and relies on two components: one collecting all possible targets and one fetching a target from that collection and generating an unconditional jump/branch there. <code>ALTER</code> is a complication because it forces the software language engineer to move all this machinery from compile time to runtime.
	* Unlike FORTRAN's <code>ASSIGN</code> statement which can be at least partially optimised because the set of possible values is known apriori for each <code>GO TO</code>, BabyCobol follows COBOL and does not restrict alterations in any way.
