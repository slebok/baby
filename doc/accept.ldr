summary: read user input and store it in variables
format: [17:] >> - "ACCEPT" - - Identifier - ^7 - ><
remarks: <ul><li>the input is expected to obey the picture clause definition of the data fields being read</li><li>Essentially, the <code>PICTURE</code> clause is a binding between the actual data and its displayed representation. For a software language engineer, it might be tempting to implement this binding as two mappings between consistent formats. The <code>ACCEPT</code> statement prevents this, since it demands a binding between an unreliable displayable representation (entered by the user) and the consistent internal representation that must be created from it, available at runtime.</li><li>In real compilers of legacy languages, the internal representation also must conform to legacy character encodings like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> and legacy binary encodings like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">BCD</a>.</li><li>If the input is erroneous, the end result in the target field must represent the fragment of entered data from the start until the error position.</li></ul>
